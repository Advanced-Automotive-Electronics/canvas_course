  <li>
    <strong>Accuracy</strong>: &plusmn;0.5&deg;C from -10&deg;C to +85&deg;C
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1-Wire protocol</strong>: Only requires one data line (plus ground)
    for communication.
  </li>

<p>
  The DS18B20 sensor comes on a module, making it easier to use with a Raspberry
  Pi. The module typically has three pins:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>VCC</strong> (Power): Connected to 3.3V or 5V.</li>
  <li><strong>GND</strong> (Ground): Connected to ground.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>SIG</strong> (Signal): Connected to a GPIO pin (usually GPIO 4 for
    1-Wire).
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <strong>SIG</strong> &rarr; Data pin that communicates via the 1-Wire
    protocol.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On the Raspberry Pi, the SIG pin is usually connected to GPIO 4 (physical pin
  7) when using the default configuration.

<h2>Understanding the DS18B20 Module and Connections</h2>
<p>
  The DS18B20 temperature sensor communicates with the Raspberry Pi using the
  <strong>1-Wire protocol</strong>, a communication protocol that allows
  multiple devices to communicate over a single data line. This protocol
  requires only one signal wire (plus ground) to transmit both data and power,
  making it simple and efficient for use in applications where multiple sensors
  are involved.
</p>
<h3>How 1-Wire Works:</h3>
<p>
  The 1-Wire protocol uses a <strong>master-slave architecture</strong>, where
  the Raspberry Pi acts as the master, and the DS18B20 sensor (or multiple
  sensors) acts as the slave. Communication occurs over a single data line (the
  signal pin), and each device on the bus has a
  <strong>unique 64-bit address</strong>. This unique address allows the
  Raspberry Pi to identify and communicate with each sensor individually, even
  when multiple sensors are connected to the same data line.
</p>
<p>
  One of the key features of the 1-Wire protocol is that it allows devices to be
  powered through the data line itself (referred to as "parasitic power"),
  although in most applications, the sensor is powered by an external source
  (3.3V or 5V) for more reliable operation.
</p>
<h3>Why We Don&rsquo;t Assign a Pin in the Code:</h3>
<p>
  Unlike protocols such as SPI or I2C, where specific pins are dedicated to
  communication, 1-Wire devices do not need to have a specific GPIO pin assigned
  in the Python code. This is because the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s operating system
  manages the 1-Wire communication through a built-in driver that automatically
  recognizes devices on the 1-Wire bus.
</p>
<p>
  In this case, the <strong>w1thermsensor</strong> library interfaces with the
  Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s 1-Wire system. The DS18B20 sensor is typically connected
  to <strong>GPIO 4 (physical pin 7)</strong> by default, which is the
  designated pin for 1-Wire communication on the Raspberry Pi. However, the
  library abstracts the complexity of specifying the exact GPIO pin in the code.
  Instead, it detects and communicates with the sensor automatically using the
  underlying system&rsquo;s 1-Wire support.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, the <strong>1-Wire protocol</strong> simplifies the connection and
  communication process with multiple sensors, and the
  <strong>w1thermsensor</strong> library further abstracts this by handling the
  sensor detection and communication without requiring explicit pin assignment
  in the code.

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Importing the library</strong>: The script starts by importing
    <code>W1ThermSensor</code> from the <code>w1thermsensor</code> library. This
    library handles all the complex communication between the Raspberry Pi and
    the DS18B20 sensor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>read_temperature function</strong>: This function creates an
    instance of the <code>W1ThermSensor</code> class, which automatically
    detects the sensor connected to the 1-Wire interface. It then calls
    <code>get_temperature()</code> to retrieve the current temperature in
    Celsius.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Main loop</strong>: The <code>main()</code> function continuously
    reads and prints the current temperature until interrupted (e.g., by
    pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code>). This loop ensures that the temperature is
    updated and displayed in real-time.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The temperature is displayed in <strong>Celsius</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    The <code>try-except</code> block is used to gracefully stop the program
    when the user interrupts it with <code>Ctrl+C</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the Code in Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>
  Once you've completed the wiring and installed the necessary libraries, you
  can run the Python code to read temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor
  directly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  By using the <code>w1thermsensor</code> library, interacting with the DS18B20
  temperature sensor becomes much easier, as it abstracts the complexities of
  the 1-Wire protocol. This page has covered the steps to install the library,
  explained the Python code to read temperature data, and reviewed the DS18B20
  sensor and its wiring schematic.

  Feel free to test the code on your Raspberry Pi and ensure the sensor is
  connected properly!
