<h2>Introduction to I2C Communication</h2>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>
  The term <strong>I2C</strong> is pronounced as "<strong>I-squared-C</strong>"
  and stands for <strong>Inter-Integrated Circuit</strong>. It is a
  communication protocol commonly used in electronics to allow microcontrollers
  and peripherals to communicate with each other. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s also
  referred to as "<strong>I-two-C</strong>."
</p>

<p>
  I2C is a serial communication protocol that allows multiple devices to
  communicate over just two shared data lines:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>SDA (Serial Data Line)</strong>: Used to transfer data between
    devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SCL (Serial Clock Line)</strong>: Used to synchronize the data
    transfer.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  What makes I2C unique is its ability to connect multiple devices (both masters
  and slaves) to the same bus, each with its own unique address, and it works
  with fewer connections compared to other communication protocols like SPI.
</p>

<h3>Drawing Parallels Between I2C and CAN Bus</h3>
<p>
  Since many of you are already familiar with <strong>CAN Bus</strong>, we can
  draw some parallels to help you understand I2C better:
</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Multi-Device Communication</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Allows multiple devices (both master and slave
    devices) to share the same bus, with each device having a unique address.
    The master initiates communication and controls the clock signal.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: Also allows multiple devices to communicate over a
    shared bus. However, in CAN, all nodes are "peers," meaning any device can
    initiate communication.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>2. <strong>Wiring</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Requires just two wires, <strong>SDA</strong> and
    <strong>SCL</strong>, to transfer data and synchronize communication. Both
    lines are pulled high by resistors and shared across all devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: Uses two wires, <strong>CAN High</strong> and
    <strong>CAN Low</strong>, for differential signaling, which helps reduce
    noise and ensures robust communication over longer distances.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>3. <strong>Data Speeds and Length</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Typically used for short distances (e.g.,
    communication within a single device or between devices on a circuit board).
    It operates at speeds of up to 400 kHz in standard mode or up to 3.4 MHz in
    high-speed mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: Designed for communication over longer distances,
    such as between different control units in a vehicle. CAN Bus typically
    operates at up to 1 Mbps, but newer standards like CAN FD allow higher data
    rates.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>4. <strong>Error Detection</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Has basic error detection through the use of
    acknowledgment bits. The receiving device sends an acknowledgment bit back
    to the sender to confirm successful data reception. However, it lacks
    advanced error-handling mechanisms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: More robust when it comes to error detection. It
    uses mechanisms like CRC checks, bit stuffing, and error counters to ensure
    data integrity.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>5. <strong>Master-Slave vs Peer-to-Peer</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Operates on a <strong>master-slave</strong> model,
    where the master controls the communication and initiates contact with slave
    devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: Operates in a <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> model,
    meaning any device on the bus can initiate communication, and arbitration is
    used to resolve conflicts.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>6. <strong>Addressing</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>I2C</strong>: Each device has a unique 7- or 10-bit address assigned
    to it. The master addresses the slave device by its address when it wants to
    communicate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CAN Bus</strong>: CAN does not use addresses in the same way.
    Instead, it uses message identifiers (IDs) to label the type of data being
    transmitted, and all nodes can listen for messages relevant to them.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Summary of Parallels:</h4>
<p>
  While both I2C and CAN Bus allow communication between multiple devices using
  only a few wires, I2C is more suited for short-distance, low-power
  communication inside devices or systems, while CAN Bus is designed for robust,
  long-distance communication in environments like vehicles.

<h3>I2C on the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>
  The Raspberry Pi supports I2C communication, which makes it ideal for
  interfacing with a wide range of sensors, displays, and other peripherals.
</p>
<p>On the Raspberry Pi, I2C is enabled using the following pins:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>SDA (Physical Pin 3)</strong>: The data line for communication.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SCL (Physical Pin 5)</strong>: The clock line for synchronization.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These pins correspond to <strong>GPIO 2 (SDA)</strong> and
  <strong>GPIO 3 (SCL)</strong>. The I2C protocol allows the Raspberry Pi to
  communicate with devices like the PCF8591 module used in this lab.
</p>
<h3>Enabling I2C on the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>To enable I2C on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li>
    Run <code>sudo raspi-config</code> to open the Raspberry Pi configuration
    tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to <code>Interface Options</code> and select <code>I2C</code>.
  </li>
  <li>Choose to enable the I2C interface.</li>
  <li>Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>I2C Addresses</h3>
<p>
  Each device connected to the I2C bus has a unique address. To find the address
  of a connected device, you can use the <code>i2cdetect</code> command:
</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install the I2C tools if they aren&rsquo;t already installed by running:
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<div
  class="contain-inline-size rounded-md border-[0.5px] border-token-border-medium relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-gray-950"
>
  <div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr">
    <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash"
      >sudo apt install i2c-tools</code
    >
  </div>
</div>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Run the following command to scan for I2C devices:</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<div
  class="contain-inline-size rounded-md border-[0.5px] border-token-border-medium relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-gray-950"
>
  <div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr">
    <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash">sudo i2cdetect -y 1</code>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  This will display a grid of addresses, showing the address of any connected
  I2C devices.

<h3>Advantages of I2C</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Simple Wiring</strong>: Only two lines (SDA and SCL) are needed for
    communication between multiple devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple Devices</strong>: The Raspberry Pi can communicate with
    several peripherals on the same bus, each identified by its unique address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Low Power</strong>: I2C is power-efficient, making it ideal for
    battery-powered projects.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Use in Lab 9</h3>
<p>
  In Lab 9, we will be using I2C to communicate with the
  <strong>PCF8591 module</strong>. This module allows us to interact with both
  analog and digital signals using I2C, which will be critical for controlling
  and reading data from various components, such as the dual-color LED module.
